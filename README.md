## Added features

I'm following [this guide](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/token-based-authentication-with-ruby-on-rails-5-api)

#### Composing User information

Use [something like this](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Aggregations/ClassMethods.html) to add User data to [User](https://github.com/juanmougan/base-project/blob/master/app/models/user.rb)
